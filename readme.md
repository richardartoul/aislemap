This project contains a custom algorithm that I wrote, as well as an accompanying HTML5 canvas visualization, for determining an efficient route through grocery store aisles based on the location of items that a user wishes to purchase. The visualization is based on randomized item data, generated at runtime, but can easily be connected to external / API data.

If you're interested in contributing, a great feature would be the ability to mouseover items and have a window popup displaying information about the item.
